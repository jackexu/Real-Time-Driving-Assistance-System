# Real-Time Driving Assistance System

*Authors: Ran Pang and Jiaqi Xu*

Used Python (OpenCV and TensorFlow) to display detected lanes, lane-keeping status, steering angle suggestion,
detected objects with estimated distance, and brake warning on real driving footages.

### Sample Output

Red numbers are the relative distances.
